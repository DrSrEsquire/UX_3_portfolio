    "string": "\r\nI am Nicholas Evans and I am a Junior at Eastern Washington University in the Visual Communication Design Program. I transferred from Spokane Falls Community College with an AAS in Graphic Design. My Passion for Visual Design started back in Highschool when I took a Graphic Design course that really opened my eyes to the Vast Design Community. I have continued in this field because of all of the amazing people that I have come across during my schooling years and all of the creative possibilities that I have yet to explore.  I will graduate from EWU in the fall of 2019 and will be looking for employment in either Web Design/Development or UX/UI Design in the Seattle or Portland area.  For the past four years I have been working as a chef at “Zentropa” then “Barrelhouse Pub & Pizza”. I was born in Spokane and was raised in the Valley.  I moved to Cheney for three years before I decided to live in Spokane for the last three years. Every year I move around and travel as much as I can. Just this last year I took a cross country road trip from Virginia back to my home town here in Spokane.  Some of my favorite hobbies include Reading, Playing Video Games and Researching up and coming technologies.  When I’m not spending my time with those hobbies, I love to cook up new recipes and add them to my cookbook and to go to new restaurants with friends. But some of the best moments that I have with my friends is when we end up playing 3-4 hours of Dungeon & Dragons every other Tuesday Night.  I also like to get outside of the house to play some golf, go to the mountains to snowboard and go hiking with my family.  \r\n"
